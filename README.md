# Tiebardemo

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.2.7.

I wrote this project as part of a coding challenge for an interview at The Tie Bar. In order to run it, make sure you have installed Node.js and npm and run `npm install` in the base folder. If you do not have the angular cli already installed, run `npm install -g @angular/cli@latest`.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
